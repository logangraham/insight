"grantReference": "BB/R008736/2", "abstractText": "Songbirds, including familiar species like chaffinches and great tits, share an unusual ability with us: vocal learning. Like us, birds need to hear and imitate others in order to develop their vocal communication signals. Most mammal and vertebrate species cannot do this, including all other primate species apart from us. In recent years, research into the development, neurobiology, and genetics of song learning have revealed ever deeper links between human speech and bird song - so much so that bird song currently represents the best animal model we have for understanding the biology of speech. \n\nIn order to study bird song, researchers need to accurately measure how different songs are from each other. These measures are needed to assess whether one bird really did imitate another, and how precisely they did so. Developing computer algorithms to make such measurements is difficult, however, for many of the same reasons that speech recognition is a difficult task for computers. In this grant, we will use a new approach to solve this problem - inspired by developments in speech recognition. First we will train birds to peck on buttons to get a food reward from a bird feeder, and then train them further to discriminate between different &quot;notes&quot; within bird songs. Then we will train &quot;machine learning&quot; computer algorithms to replicate the birds' decisions. We will thus develop a computer algorithm that we can use to compare bird songs in a way that is biologically validated.\n\nWe will then use our algorithm to investigate how birds learn their songs. To do this, we will make use of data-sets where researchers have simply recorded the different songs sung by birds within the population. This data contains a signature of how the birds actually learned their songs in much the same way that our genomes contain signatures of our evolutionary history. We will exploit this by using a statistical technique in combination with simulation models to infer how birds learn their songs: how frequently they generate new song types due to errors or innovations; who they prefer to learn from; and which songs they prefer to learn. We will do this for 15 different species and populations, allowing us to compare how different groups learn their songs for the first time.", "technicalSummary": "Bird song learning research has been built on our ability to judge the similarity between song syllables, but current methods have not been validated against birds' own perception. In order to carry out the next generation of studies of song learning, we need to develop more accurate methods, rooted in biology. And to do that, we first need comprehensive data-sets of how birds themselves perceive differences in song syllables.\n\nObjective 1: Generate data-sets for how birds perceive differences between song syllables using operant conditioning methods, using an AXB task, for three unrelated species: zebra finch, great tit and jackdaw. We will generate around 150,000 trials. \n\nObjective 2: Develop and train machine learning algorithms to measure song syllable similarity. Recent developments in machine learning provide powerful methods for fitting algorithms to complex time series data, like bird song syllables. We will develop and train algorithms using the results from Objective 1. We will compare the performance of our algorithm against current methods, and will host a data tournament for the machine learning field to further search for optimal solutions.\n\nObjective 3: Apply the machine learning algorithms developed in Objective 2 to a fundamental problem in bird song learning: we lack quantitative estimates for how precisely birds learn songs. Without this information, it is impossible to take advantage of the diversity of bird song learning styles in different species and gain a comparative understanding of how song learning behaviour evolves. For this objective, we will (a) collate patterns of song sharing in populations of birds of 15 different taxa; (b) compare syllable structure of all songs within each of the populations using our algorithm; (c) use Approximate Bayesian Computing to fit the results to cultural evolutionary simulations, and thus estimate underlying parameters of learning - in particular the precision of syllable imitation.", "potentialImpactText": "We will generate a state-of-the-art method for comparing the similarity of bird songs, and a data-set for other researchers to use when developing their own methods. Our method will be incorporated into a song-analysis program (Luscinia) that will be readily useable by members of the research field. Research that will benefit from these methods has the following impacts:\n (a) Biomonitoring. Bird song is often the best record that we have of avian biodiversity - especially in tropical forests where biodiversity is highest and visibility of birds very limited. Processing hours of song recordings manually is a difficult and skilled task, and recently, interest has grown in computational methods that can automate the task. Our project will add to this by developing the first method validated by avian perception itself. Both R-Co-I Stowell (developer of Warblr), and PI Lachlan (developer of Luscinia) have a proven track record in implementing computational bioacoustic techniques for a broader audience.\n (b) Biodiversity. Song often provides one of the critical phenotypic cues needed to identify new species. In some cases, song is the only clear and unambiguous character. To use song features to distinguish taxa, an accurate way to quantitatively compare songs is required; we will create and make this available to the field via the Luscinia software. The less sophisticated measures already implemented in Luscinia have already been used for this purpose, helping to identify the Gran Canarian Blue Chaffinch as a separate species from the Tenerife Blue Chaffinch, and in so doing, discovering the rarest, and one of the most endangered bird species in the E.U. Other labs are currently carrying out similar studies in Colombia and Tanzania amongst other places. \n (c) Bird song neuroscience. Bird song is an established model system for speech, at a neurobiological and genomic level. Genes involved with bird song learning have been implicated in human disease. Research into this field requires accurate assessments of song structure and song similarity, which we will deliver. Through PI Lachlan's work on Luscinia, and co-PI Clayton's senior position in the bird song neurobiology field, we again have a clear plan of how we will make our methods available to a broader field and advertise them.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 426688, "start": "2019-04-01", "end": "2021-06-03", "funder": {"id": "2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7", "name": "BBSRC", "url":

"Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "grantReference": "BB/R008736/1", "abstractText": "Songbirds, including familiar species like chaffinches and great tits, share an unusual ability with us: vocal learning. Like us, birds need to hear and imitate others in order to develop their vocal communication signals. Most mammal and vertebrate species cannot do this, including all other primate species apart from us. In recent years, research into the development, neurobiology, and genetics of song learning have revealed ever deeper links between human speech and bird song - so much so that bird song currently represents the best animal model we have for understanding the biology of speech. \n\nIn order to study bird song, researchers need to accurately measure how different songs are from each other. These measures are needed to assess whether one bird really did imitate another, and how precisely they did so. Developing computer algorithms to make such measurements is difficult, however, for many of the same reasons that speech recognition is a difficult task for computers. In this grant, we will use a new approach to solve this problem - inspired by developments in speech recognition. First we will train birds to peck on buttons to get a food reward from a bird feeder, and then train them further to discriminate between different &quot;notes&quot; within bird songs. Then we will train &quot;machine learning&quot; computer algorithms to replicate the birds' decisions. We will thus develop a computer algorithm that we can use to compare bird songs in a way that is biologically validated.\n\nWe will then use our algorithm to investigate how birds learn their songs. To do this, we will make use of data-sets where researchers have simply recorded the different songs sung by birds within the population. This data contains a signature of how the birds actually learned their songs in much the same way that our genomes contain signatures of our evolutionary history. We will exploit this by using a statistical technique in combination with simulation models to infer how birds learn their songs: how frequently they generate new song types due to errors or innovations; who they prefer to learn from; and which songs they prefer to learn. We will do this for 15 different species and populations, allowing us to compare how different groups learn their songs for the first time.", "technicalSummary": "Bird song learning research has been built on our ability to judge the similarity between song syllables, but current methods have not been validated against birds' own perception. In order to carry out the next generation of studies of song learning, we need to develop more accurate methods, rooted in biology. And to do that, we first need comprehensive data-sets of how birds themselves perceive differences in song syllables.\n\nObjective 1: Generate data-sets for how birds perceive differences between song syllables using operant conditioning methods, using an AXB task, for three unrelated species: zebra finch, great tit and jackdaw. We will generate around 150,000 trials. \n\nObjective 2: Develop and train machine learning algorithms to measure song syllable similarity. Recent developments in machine learning provide powerful methods for fitting algorithms to complex time series data, like bird song syllables. We will develop and train algorithms using the results from Objective 1. We will compare the performance of our algorithm against current methods, and will host a data tournament for the machine learning field to further search for optimal solutions.\n\nObjective 3: Apply the machine learning algorithms developed in Objective 2 to a fundamental problem in bird song learning: we lack quantitative estimates for how precisely birds learn songs. Without this information, it is impossible to take advantage of the diversity of bird song learning styles in different species and gain a comparative understanding of how song learning behaviour evolves. For this objective, we will (a) collate patterns of song sharing in populations of birds of 15 different taxa; (b) compare syllable structure of all songs within each of the populations using our algorithm; (c) use Approximate Bayesian Computing to fit the results to cultural evolutionary simulations, and thus estimate underlying parameters of learning - in particular the precision of syllable imitation.", "potentialImpactText": "We will generate a state-of-the-art method for comparing the similarity of bird songs, and a data-set for other researchers to use when developing their own methods. Our method will be incorporated into a song-analysis program (Luscinia) that will be readily useable by members of the research field. Research that will benefit from these methods has the following impacts:\n (a) Biomonitoring. Bird song is often the best record that we have of avian biodiversity - especially in tropical forests where biodiversity is highest and visibility of birds very limited. Processing hours of song recordings manually is a difficult and skilled task, and recently, interest has grown in computational methods that can automate the task. Our project will add to this by developing the first method validated by avian perception itself. Both R-Co-I Stowell (developer of Warblr), and PI Lachlan (developer of Luscinia) have a proven track record in implementing computational bioacoustic techniques for a broader audience.\n (b) Biodiversity. Song often provides one of the critical phenotypic cues needed to identify new species. In some cases, song is the only clear and unambiguous character. To use song features to distinguish taxa, an accurate way to quantitatively compare songs is required; we will create and make this available to the field via the Luscinia software. The less sophisticated measures already implemented in Luscinia have already been used for this purpose, helping to identify the Gran Canarian Blue Chaffinch as a separate species from the Tenerife Blue Chaffinch, and in so doing, discovering the rarest, and one of the most endangered bird species in the E.U. Other labs are currently carrying out similar studies in Colombia and Tanzania amongst other places. \n (c) Bird song neuroscience. Bird song is an established model system for speech, at a neurobiological and genomic level. Genes involved with bird song learning have been implicated in human disease. Research into this field requires accurate assessments of song structure and song similarity, which we will deliver. Through PI Lachlan's work on Luscinia, and co-PI Clayton's senior position in the bird song neurobiology field, we again have a clear plan of how we will make our methods available to a broader field and advertise them.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 535796, "start": "2018-06-04", "end": "2019-03-31", "funder": {"id": "2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7", "name": "BBSRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [{"id": "DD1C1FB0-CFF2-40B6-A578-8F3B3D507452", "outcomeId": "5e5fb785aab344.75870405", "title": "Operant bird feeder", "description": "We have further refined an operant bird feeder and have successfully used it in our experiments.

As a world we are generating ever greater volumes of\ndata, and we need to find effective ways to gather and analyse that data, often by searching for regular patterns in data\nsets. The human eye is very good at picking out patterns either from images or from simple time series graphs. However,\nthe human eye comes with its own biases: if you are trying to pick out blips in a single line trace on a screen your selection\nmay not always be the same, but may depend on what has come before. Reproducibility is a huge issue here and one\nwhich impacts any kind of data science: if we are to do an experiment, or pick out interesting features from data, we want to\nmake sure we get the same result every time given the same initial input. Furthermore, as our input data streams get\nbigger and bigger, it is extremely time consuming (and a bit boring!) to look through all the data by eye to pick out the kind\nof features that we want. This is where the extremely powerful tool known as machine learning can help. In this work we\npropose to use machine learning to pick out particular signatures from large catagloues of Space Physics data - but the\ncomputer analysis methods that we will develop will be applicable across multiple disciplines.\n\nThe Space Physics problem we are interested in is called magnetic reconnection: it is a very energetic process which can\ntake place when two oppositely directed magnetic field lines meet, come together, and break. Right before reconnection\nhappens the field lines are holding lots of energy, but as soon as they break this energy can be released into multiple forms\nincluding kinetic energy and thermal energy (heating). The field lines change shape after they break and these newly shaped\nfield lines can &quot;ping&quot; away from the site of reconnection, much like an elastic band that has been snapped. The\nfield lines also carry with them charged particles, and these particles can heat up or change their flow direction as a result\nof the transfer of energy.\n\nIn the solar system everything happens on a giant scale, and magnetic reconnection can involve the magnetic field lines\nand plasma of the Sun and of several magnetised planets, including, but not limited to Mercury, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn.\nSpacecraft flying through the solar system have instruments which can measure magnetic fields and plasmas, and thus\ncan sample any changes associated with reconnection.\n\nThe changes in the shape and orientation of magnetic fields and in the temperature and flow characteristics of charged\nparticles can be observed by spacecraft. When scientists examine spacecraft data to search for evidence of this\nreconnection process, they know what they are looking for in the field and plasma data. There is a huge amount of\nspacecraft data: years and years' worth, with measurements taken several times a second. Reconnection can happen\nevery few minutes at some planets. It would be impossible for a human being to look through all the data and pick out\nevery time reconnection happened in our enormous catalogue.\n\nThe purpose of this research is to teach the computer what reconnection signatures look like to a human eye, and to train\nthe computer to pick these signatures out itself. This technique is called machine learning, and it has many advantages,\nbecause computers can be taught to work more quickly than humans, to give the same answer every time, and to not show\nbiases.\n\nThe ultimate goal at the end of this project is to have trained the computer to select reconnection signatures, and to be able\nto roll out this technique on multiple data sets from the solar system. This will be particularly useful for scientists who want\nto conduct large studies of the behaviour of magnetic fields and plasma across the solar system, under different conditions\nand over multiple years.", "potentialImpactText": "Several different groups will benefit from this research. As mentioned in the Academic Beneficiaries section, the machine\nlearning algorithms that will be developed will be of use to those interested in studying reconnection and those who wish to\nconduct statistical studies of field and plasma fluctuations in planetary magnetospheres and the solar wind. The work may\nfeed directly into improved knowledge of Space Weather.\n\nFurthermore, the economic and social beneficiaries of this research will primarily include industrial and governmental\ngroups linked to space technology and space weather. Such groups include:\nUK Space - trade association of the UK space industry http://www.ukspace.org/what-we-do/\nThe Cabinet office and National Security and Intelligence, who maintain the National Risk Register, of which Space\nWeather is a part: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-risk-register-of-civil-emergencies\n\nModern society is increasingly reliant on space-based technologies for their everyday lives and reconnection events which\ntransfer huge amounts of energy have consequences on modern technological infrastructure in the Space and Energy\nsectors. These include damage to satellites, especially from surface charging, and disruptions to satellite communications\nand navigation due to ionospheric absorption and scintillation, to electricity supply due to electrical currents induced in the\nground from ionospheric currents, and to oil and mineral prospecting due to geomagnetic field fluctuations. Such so-called\n'space weather' hazards are now considered to be sufficiently important to have been included in the latest UK Government\nNational Risk Register. Providing information directly relevant to predictive space weather modelling efforts is the first step\ntowards providing advance warning for low-frequency, but high-consequence events such as those identified by the top UK\nand US Science Advisors Holdren and Beddington who warn &quot;The potential total cost of an extreme Space Weather event\nis estimated as $2 Trillion in year 1 in the U.S. alone, with a 4-10 year recovery period&quot;.\n\nThe UK Meteorological Office is responsible for providing space weather predictive capability and any large statistical\nstudies, enabled by the use of machine learning algorithms such as those we propose, will feed into this predictive\ncapability. More generally, the effects of space weather can be felt in all activities that use space-related assets.

Some proofs may yield the same pattern of tactics, \nand can be fully automated, and others may require a user's intervention.\nIn this case, manually found proof for one problematic lemma may serve as a template for several other lemmas needing a manual proof.\nAt present this kind of proof-pattern recognition and recycling is done by hand, and the ML-CAP project will look into methods to automate this. \n\nAnother issue is that unsuccessful attempts of proofs --- in the trial-and-error phase of proof-search, are normally discarded once the proof is found.\nConveniently, analysis of both positive and negative examples is inherent in statistical machine learning. And ML-CAP is going to exploit this.\n\nHowever, applying statistical machine-learning methods to analyse data coming from proof theory is a challenging task for several reasons. \nFormulae written in formal language have a precise, rather than a statistical nature. \nFor example, list(nil) may be a well-formed term, while list(nol) - not; although they may have similar patterns \nrecognisable by machine learning methods.\n\nAnother problem that arises when merging formal logic and statistical machine-learning algorithms is related to their computational complexity.\nMany essential logic algorithms are P-complete and inherently sequential (e.g., first-order unification), while neural networks and other similar devices \nare based on linear algebra and perform parallel computations.\n\nAs a solution to the outlined problems, the coalgebraic approach to automated proofs \nmay provide the right technique of abstraction allowing to analyse proof-patterns using machine learning methods. \nFirstly, coalgebraic computations lend themselves to concurrency, \nand this may be the key to obtaining adequate representation\nof the outlined problems.\nSecondly, they are based on the idea of repeating patterns of potentially infinite computations, rather than outputs of finite computations. \nThese patterns may be detected by methods of statistical pattern recognition. \n\nML-CAP is based upon a novel method of using statistical machine learning in analysis of formal proofs.\nIn summary, it provides algorithms for extracting those features from automated proofs that allow to detect proof patterns \n using statistical machine learning tools, such as neural networks.\nAs a result, neural networks can be trained to distinguish well-formed proofs from ill-formed; distinguish whether a proof belongs to a given family of proofs, \nand even make accurate predictions concerning potential success of a proof-in-progress. All three tasks have serious applications in automated reasoning. \nThe project will aim to generalise this method and develop it into a sound general technique for automated proofs. It will result in new methods useful \nfor a range of researchers in different areas, such as AI, Formal Methods, Coalgebra and Cognitive Science.", "potentialImpactText": "Impact Summary.\n\n1. Knowledge (science and technology). \nThe proposed research is a pilot attempt to merge two very different groups of methods - \nstatistical machine learning and formal methods - using a third group of coalgebraic methods as a method of abstraction and suitable representation. \nThe ultimate goal for the resulting technique is to advance real-life applications of ITPs,\nin the aspects where decidable algorithms and methods are not possible. \nThe project is distinctly interdisciplinary and has an original research idea and methodology underlying it. \nMy discussions of the proposed idea and method with\nvarious groups of researchers at AI4FM'11 (AI and Formal Methods community), STP'11 (Theorem Proving community), \nand ITP'11 [f] (Inductive Logic and Machine Learning communities) have confirmed my belief that \nmy approach is indeed new and ground-breaking, (see also letters of support).\n\n \nI see the EPSRC First Grant scheme as an excellent opportunity to invest efforts into proving the concept,\ndeveloping more evidence and accumulating data supporting the proposed ML-CAP method, with a view to a bigger project if the pilot studies are successful. \nAnother important consequence of the proposed work will be \nbuilding confidence among various communities of researchers in both AI and Formal Methods in the potential of \nstatistical machine-learning methods as useful tools in handling \nundecidable aspects of automated reasoning. \n\n2. Economy and Society.\nThe project contributes to a long-term goal of\nachieving the Grand Challenge in Computing - Dependable systems evolution; \nas explained in detail in the Background section.\n\nThe proposed method will help to automate those \nsteps in formal proofs that cannot be automated using the state-of-the-art technology available today.\nThe new technology will directly affect programmers working on software and hardware verification.\nIn the longer term, the new method will make the process of software verification by means of ITPs lighter, faster, and hence cheaper,\nand thus will have serious economic impact.\nAlso, ML-CAP will work towards creation of new technologies, and therefore may trigger creation of new companies.\n\nAs Formal methods improve dependability and security of software, development of these technologies will ultimately have an effect on the Society in terms of the security and quality of life.\nAs A. Ireland states in the attached letter of support,\n``The pervasive nature of software means that software dependability plays a crucial role within the\nworld economy, as well as the security - from maintaining national security through to protecting\npersonal data.''\n\n\n3.

We developed a new method of interfacing interactive theorem provers with state-of-the-art machine-learning engines, in real time.\n\n1.2 We developed a new method to dynamically extract statistical features from interactive proofs\n\n1.3 We developed a new method to run and post-process the results of machine-learning algorithms data-mining the computerised proof libraries\n\n1.4 We developed a method to automatically generate and prove new lemmas/theorems on the basis of automatically discovered statistics of old proofs.\n\n1.5 We developed a software tool ML4PG that data-mines Coq proofs, now it has become a standard package of Proof General software (Edinburgh University).\n\n1.5 We developed a new tool - ACL2(ml), implementing the above techniques in ACL2 language, and engaged with SICSA and industries to disseminate it further via Industrial Proof of Concept grant.\n\n\n\n2. Coalgebraic Logic Programming (CoALP)\n\n2.1. We further improved the parallel implementation of CoALP, and formally described its parallel features in two journal papers;\n\n2.2. We further developed guarded corecursion in CoALP;\n\n2.3 We issued a new version of CoALP, implemented in parallel language GoLang.\n\n2.4. the above work on CoALP gave rise to another EPSRC grant that implement CoALP in Type Inference in a range of Programming Languages", "exploitationPathways": "Software and Hardware Verification in Coq and SSReflect (for ML4PG)\n\nSoftware and Hardware Verification in ACL2 (for ACL2(ml))\n\nCompilers, Type inference in Programming languages (for CoALP)\n All software and documentation are made publicly available here:\n\nProject progress summary: \n\nhttp://www.computing.dundee.ac.uk/staff/katya/MLCAP-man/\n\nML4PG software and documentation:\n\nhttp://www.computing.dundee.ac.uk/staff/katya/ML4PG/\n\nCoALP software and documentation:\n\nhttp://www.computing.dundee.ac.uk/staff/katya/CoALP/\n\nSpin-off of ML4PG work was ACL2(ml) work, funded by SICSA Industrial grant\n\nhttp://staff.computing.dundee.ac.uk/jheras/acl2ml/\n\nWe already know of several academic users of the ML4PG system.", "url": "http://staff.computing.dundee.ac.uk/katya/MLCAP-man/", "sector": ["Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)"]}}, "publication": [{"title": "Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Reasoning", "author": [{"otherNames": "Heras J", "id": "55c8cdae15213981d3b8168f5c891236", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/55c8cdae15213981d3b8168f5c891236"}], "date": "2013-01-01", "isbn": "978-3-642-45220-8", "id": "B6F6C772-4A0E-456D-BC21-6318027C0234", "outcomeId": "doi_53cfd0fd0639e7b1", "firstAuthorName": "Heras J"}, {"title": "Intelligent Computer Mathematics", "author": [{"otherNames": "Heras J", "id": "55c8cdae15213981d3b8168f5c891236", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/55c8cdae15213981d3b8168f5c891236"}], "date": "2013-01-01", "isbn": "978-3-642-39319-8", "id": "B750F153-ED8B-4577-B20D-B9AD51020BE5", "outcomeId": "doi_53cfd0fd037142bb", "firstAuthorName": "Heras J"}, {"title": "Automated Reasoning Workshop 2013", "author": [{"otherNames": "Ekaterina Komendantskaya (Author)", "id": "cc7f289e3f990e4d6f090b456da72a7f", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/cc7f289e3f990e4d6f090b456da72a7f"}], "date": "2014-01-01", "id": "1AB35914-BC09-4F60-BB50-946DDCBA786E", "outcomeId": "m_918874138513a8cac4", "firstAuthorName": "Ekaterina Komendantskaya (Author)"}, {"title": "Recycling Proof Patterns in Coq: Case Studies", "parentPublicationTitle": "Mathematics in Computer Science", "author": [{"otherNames": "Heras J", "id": "55c8cdae15213981d3b8168f5c891236", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/55c8cdae15213981d3b8168f5c891236"}], "date": "2014-01-01", "id": "57C19D75-E096-4C68-9C0F-6E0E2CC95B01", "outcomeId": "545399bc6a6202.94479766", "firstAuthorName": "Heras J"}, {"title": "Programming Languages and Systems -

{"title": "Keep Learning", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "grantReference": "EP/V026534/1", "abstractText": "Combinatorial problems are ubiquitous across many sectors in today's world: delivering optimised solutions can lead to considerable economic benefits in many fields such as logistics, packing, design and scheduling (of either people or processes). In a typical scenario, instances (for example, a set of goods to deliver) arrive frequently in a continual stream and a solution needs to be quickly produced. Although there are many well-known approaches to developing optimisation algorithms, most suffer from a problem that is now becoming apparent across the breadth of Artificial Intelligence: systems are limited to performing well on data that is similar to that encountered in their design process, and are unable to adapt when encountering situations outside of their original programming.\n\n\nFor real-world optimisation this is particularly problematic. If optimisers are trained in a one-off process then deployed, the system remains static, despite the fact that optimisation occurs in a dynamic world of changing instance characteristics, changing user-requirements and changes in operating environments that influence solution quality (e.g. breakdowns in a factory or traffic in a city). Such changes may be either gradual, or sudden. In the best case this leads to systems that deliver sub-optimal performance, while at worst, systems that are completely unfit for purpose. Moreover, a system that does not adapt wastes an obvious opportunity to improve its own performance over time as it solves more and more instances.\n\nThe targeted breakthrough of this proposal is to develop a dynamic optimisation system that continually adapts its operating mechanism and its algorithms over time to remain fit-for-purpose - a radical switch from the current one-off design and deployment approach to design of optimisers. The system will:\n\n- Go beyond simply being reactive to being proactive in that it will predict the nature of upcoming instances and speculate about potential future scenarios. In response to these predictions, it will autonomously pre-generate and/or reconfigure suitable algorithms, followed by creation of appropriate mappings from instance to solver, in order to pre-prepare for these future scenarios.

In a typical scenario, instances (for example, a set of goods to deliver) arrive frequently in a continual stream and a solution needs to be quickly produced. Although there are many well-known approaches to developing optimisation algorithms, most suffer from a problem that is now becoming apparent across the breadth of Artificial Intelligence: systems are limited to performing well on data that is similar to that encountered in their design process, and are unable to adapt when encountering situations outside of their original programming.\n\n\nFor real-world optimisation this is particularly problematic. If optimisers are trained in a one-off process then deployed, the system remains static, despite the fact that optimisation occurs in a dynamic world of changing instance characteristics, changing user-requirements and changes in operating environments that influence solution quality (e.g. breakdowns in a factory or traffic in a city). Such changes may be either gradual, or sudden. In the best case this leads to systems that deliver sub-optimal performance, while at worst, systems that are completely unfit for purpose. Moreover, a system that does not adapt wastes an obvious opportunity to improve its own performance over time as it solves more and more instances.\n\nThe targeted breakthrough of this proposal is to develop a dynamic optimisation system that continually adapts its operating mechanism and its algorithms over time to remain fit-for-purpose - a radical switch from the current one-off design and deployment approach to design of optimisers. The system will:\n\n- Go beyond simply being reactive to being proactive in that it will predict the nature of upcoming instances and speculate about potential future scenarios. In response to these predictions, it will autonomously pre-generate and/or reconfigure suitable algorithms, followed by creation of appropriate mappings from instance to solver, in order to pre-prepare for these future scenarios. It will also respond to user requests to generate instances with specific characteristics and solvers to match them, based on the user's in-depth knowledge of their own business and sector.\n\n- Autonomously improve its own behaviour over time, continually updating its algorithms and methods as it learns from its experience of solving more and more instances.\n\n- Support optimisation with respect to multiple user objectives and requirements via its use of a diverse portfolios of algorithms, that range from those which generate acceptable solutions in a very short time to those that have long running time but deliver the highest possible quality.\n\nTo succeed we will make novel advances in building proactive, continually self-adapting systems and in optimisation/algorithm-selection, enhanced by integration with the latest tools from machine-learning.

They are crucial to organisms which use them to carry out a huge variety of essential functions: catalysis, transport, storage, motor functions, signalling, chaperoning folding, regulation, molecular recognition, structural roles, and DNA Repair. As proteins are so ubiquitous in biology, understanding their properties is essential if we want to know about biological processes. This project is focused on one of the most significant of all protein functions: enzyme catalysis. Enzymes catalyse, or facilitate, the chemical reactions that occur in living organisms. Understanding how they work is both interesting in itself and useful in areas as diverse as drug design, diagnostics, biofuels, food science and laundry. This project is about the relationship between the structure of a protein and the enzyme function it carries out. We aim to predict the catalytic functionality from a knowledge of the protein structure. In order to achieve this, we will use machine learning methods, and in particular a technique called Random Forest. The forest consists of several hundred 'decision trees', each of which is basically a flow diagram. We will train them to learn patterns in the known properties of existing enzyme structures and the chemistry of the steps comprising the reactions they catalyse. However, the way in which we will generate the trees involves computer-simulated dice-rolling. This will ensure that they are all different, though based on the same underlying information. The decision trees then each make a prediction of the unknown possible catalytic functions. These predictions are treated as votes as to the function of the protein. This voting process produces a consensus of many decision trees and maximises the use of the information contained in the underlying data, generating results which are much more accurate than those of any one decision tree. The prediction of enzyme function is immensely important for a number of reasons. Firstly, being able to predict enzyme function more accurately will improve the functional annotation of genomes and reduce the current risk of misannotations being propagated through bioinformatics databases. Rapid developments in structural genomics, high throughput structure determination of diverse proteins from a wide variety of organisms, mean that many structures are available for enzymes whose functions are not yet known. Secondly, this project will allow us to recognise chemical similarities between evolutionarily unrelated enzymes that catalyse similar steps, though not necessarily similar overall reactions. Thirdly, this work will help us to understand the key determinants of the complex relationship between protein structure, function and evolution, particularly in terms of catalysis of reaction steps. Fourthly, the project will facilitate the design of new enzymes with either novel functions or carefully modified versions of existing functions. This project sits at an interface between disciplines, combining chemistry, biology and computer science. A wide range of skills and expertise is necessary to increase our understanding of catalysis, which has long been an important academic goal. Commercially, this work lays a foundation which is directly useful to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, where enzymes are used both as diagnostics and therapeutics; the agrochemical industry, whose products often target enzymes; in the development of biofuels, which need robust enzymes to improve productivity and reduce costs; in laundry, where enzymes are already used in everyday products; and in the nutrition and food industries. In particular this project will aid in the design of new and repurposed enzymes.", "technicalSummary": "The key idea in our work is to identify the reaction mechanism, if any, catalysed enzymatically by a protein structure. Here, the reaction mechanisms are the 260 distinct entries in MACiE. The possible predictions are that the enzyme catalyses each of these reactions, or catalyses no enzyme reaction in our knowledge base. Our work, including a study of convergently evolved analogous pairs of enzymes, suggests that the full stepwise chemical reaction mechanism contains information critical to recognising similarities between enzymes. Our main machine learning method is Random Forest, simply a forest made out of many different randomly created decision trees. Randomness is introduced in two ways. Firstly, each tree is based on a bootstrap sample of N out of the N known proteins, chosen with replacement such that some proteins will appear more than once and others not at all in the set from which a given tree is built. Secondly, the descriptors used for making the split at each node are chosen from a (new) small random subset of the descriptors. Once grown, the trees then predict unseen data. Random Forest can predict either a categorical or a continuous variable. Here, our interest is in classification; the class assigned to a new protein is that given the most votes amongst the trees in the forest. Subsequently to predicting the reaction mechanism, we will apply chemoinformatics, docking and Ultrafast Shape Recognition to suggest substrates for each enzyme reaction identified. Docking is a computational filter, reducing the number of candidates by more than an order of magnitude. Rescoring will use our novel Random Forest based RF-Score function. We will use fingerprint-based chemoinformatics methods to retain only molecules with the correct chemical functionalities needed to undergo the reaction mechanisms identified, and Ultrafast Shape Recognition as a scaffold-hopping method to identify molecules of suitable shape.", "potentialImpactText": "The key beneficiaries are companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical technology sectors; other possible beneficiary fields are biofuels, foods, agrochemicals, and 'home and personal care'. This work centres on new aspects of function prediction, complementary to those used elsewhere, and we envisage that our methods will take their place amongst the arsenal of tools in the workflows for protein function prediction and gene annotation. We expect our methods to be most valuable when used alongside other state-of-the art techniques for predicting protein function from sequence and structure. One element of the strategy for increasing the impact of our function prediction work is to encourage its use in private sector R &amp; D. This naturally includes large pharmaceutical companies, but we are particularly keen to see SMEs, biotechnology and smaller medical technology companies, many of whom do not have the resources to fund large in-house computational resources, make use of our predictive models. A key aspect of this is eliminating any IP-related barriers to the commercial use both of our predictive models and also of MACiE. Our function prediction software and models will be freely available on a Creative Commons license. The IP status is that all data in MACiE are public domain. Almost always, these are published, or very soon to be published, by their authors. We are prepared to embargo data pre-publication, but not afterwards. The database itself is copyrighted, and we may in future include a light touch Open Data Commons licence. This is intended only to prevent extreme cases of plagiarism, such as copying the entire database and passing it off as the work of others, and we positively encourage the use of our predictive models, and also data from MACiE, in commercial research and development. The second part of our strategy is to increase visibility. Dr Mitchell is in the fortunate position of receiving regular invitations to speak both directly to pharmaceutical, chemical and other commercial organisations (Pfizer, GSK, Unilever, Syngenta, Schering-Plough etc.), and also at conferences designed for the pharmaceutical industry (Improving Solubility 2008; ADMET 2009; Improving Solubility 2009; ADMET Europe 2010; UK-QSAR spring 2010). Here we can discuss our work in formal presentations and through informal networking. Other ideas for impact in the shorter term include authoring articles describing our work on function prediction and the related work on MACiE. There would be three specific target groups. One of these is research and development scientists in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. To reach them, an article in Drug Discovery Today or a similar 'trade magazine' would be an appropriate medium. The second target audience is young people (particularly the 16-21 age group) with an interest in science. While this already happens on a small scale via UCAS open days and the like, we are particularly interested in opening up discussion of science through the blogosphere, see for instance http://baoilleach.blogspot.com/2009/05/how-do-enzyme-mechanisms-evolve.html We are also very aware of the benefits of including relevant parts of our own research in undergraduate teaching material. The third target group is the broader public, who could be impacted by general interest magazine or newspaper articles, as well as by the blogs and other internet-based content. We also hope to secure a slot to present the work to the public at a local event such as those organised by Cafe Science Dundee. The University of St Andrews is a partner in the 'Create and Inspire' public engagement training days for young scientists at Sensation science centre. We believe that MACiE has potential as an educational resource. As well as undergraduate teaching, it could also be a valuable resource for year 13 chemistry teaching in school sixth forms (e.g., Salters' A-level module 'Thread of Life').", "fund": {"valuePounds": 265110, "start": "2011-09-01", "end": "2014-12-31", "funder": {"id": "2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7", "name": "BBSRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [], "artisticAndCreativeProductOutput": [], "softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput": [], "researchDatabaseAndModelOutput": [{"id": "F1D3FECA-FA47-4B10-883E-C2CA797516EC", "outcomeId": "84e274c00babc88", "title": "DLS-100 Solubility Dataset", "description": "100 Molecules with measured and reported intrinsic aqueous solubilities, together with a suggested 75-25 training-test split.", "type": "Database/Collection of data", "providedToOthers": true, "yearFirstProvided": 2017}], "spinOutOutput": [], "impactSummaryOutput": [{"id": "AB50DB9C-D652-4225-8198-C175D3BF341E", "outcomeId": "56bdd010bfddd9.90021674", "description": "The software associated with this project has been made publically available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/ml2db/ for use by SMEs and larger companies, for instance in the biotech and pharmaceuticals sectors.

The availability of the Research roadmap as it evolves will communicate the emerging research agenda to external agencies as well as direct adopters and developers of research results. \n\nThe annual Network workshops will be an excellent means with which to communicate developments within the Network and act as a means of establishing new collaborations within and without the Network to further widen access to Network activities.\n\nIn addition joint publications in the main journals and presentation at the main conferences of each of the respective areas covered will be pursued to ensure persistence of visibility of the outcome of Network based collaborations.

In 2016, 5/10 best-selling drugs worldwide were antibodies, including the record-breaking Humira which took &pound;12bn in sales, the highest ever for any pharmaceutical. The global antibody therapeutics market is expected to continue to grow at a remarkable pace, reaching &pound;88bn by 2020, driven by the high incidence of chronic diseases which urgently require more effective treatments. High R&amp;D costs and strict regulatory measures may however remain the longstanding challenges for pharmaceutical companies, hampering market growth.\n\nAntibody discovery is the process of discovering an antibody to bind to a particular antigen. Existing methods are through immunisation of animals (rabbits, mice), or by screening a large antibody library. While these physical platforms are usually able to discover binding antibodies, they require targets that are well-formed and available purified in sufficient quantities. Even then, the process is time consuming and expensive, and existing techniques suffer from throughput, scalability, repeatability and quality issues.\n\nAntiverse is building a world-first computational antibody discovery platform combining state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict antibodies that bind to a given antigen target with high affinity. The company has a vision to overturn the &pound;3.5bn antibody drug discovery market, replacing existing antibody discovery techniques with a novel solution to design antibody drugs _in silico_, whilst massively reducing the cost (up to &pound;300K/candidate) and time to discover new candidates, from 3 to 18 months down to just one day.\n\nAntiverse is well placed to exploit this opportunity, having already established a basic model with an initial dataset containing public data to prove technical feasibility. The company has secured laboratory space for generating a proprietary dataset at scale to develop the model and has good industry links and connections with major biopharmaceutical companies and contract research organisations (CROs) that have already expressed a keen interest in trialling the solution once developed.\n\nThis project will enable Antiverse to develop the machine learning algorithm and a large proprietary dataset with at least 10,000 data points required to prove the generative model, facilitating the subsequent development of a platform that can be trialled with industry partners to accelerate the service offering towards commercialisation by mid-2020, helping to establish this UK SME at the forefront of the antibody drug discovery market poised for significant growth.&quot;", "fund": {"valuePounds": 69748, "start": "2018-10-01", "end": "2019-12-31", "funder": {"id": "05923FEC-036B-4EA9-8068-0AD5AE082931", "name": "Innovate UK", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/05923FEC-036B-4EA9-8068-0AD5AE082931"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [], "artisticAndCreativeProductOutput": [], "softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput": [], "researchDatabaseAndModelOutput": [], "spinOutOutput": [], "impactSummaryOutput": [], "furtherFundingOutput": [], "otherResearchOutput": [], "exploitationOutput": [], "disseminationOutput": []}, "publication": [], "identifier": [{"value": "104437", "type": "RCUK"}], "healthCategory": [], "researchActivity": [], "researchSubject": [], "researchTopic": [{"id": "D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819", "text": "Unclassified", "encodedText": "Unclassified"}], "rcukProgramme": [], "id": "B15E0AA5-531C-4642-B092-A846028B1CAE", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/projects?ref=104437"}, "leadResearchOrganisation": {"name": "AntiverSE Ltd", "address": {"line1": "34 Roath Court Road", "city": "Cardiff", "postCode": "CF24 3SD", "region": "Unknown"}, "typeInd": "P", "id": "8712E96E-B7C4-44B5-B80F-76DF545D9419", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/8712E96E-B7C4-44B5-B80F-76DF545D9419"}, "personRole": [{"role": [{"name": "PROJECT_MANAGER"}], "id": "750F9C4B-AC87-43F1-B583-5DA030F8274F", "firstName": "Murat", "surname": "Tunaboylu", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/750F9C4B-AC87-43F1-B583-5DA030F8274F"}], "collaborator": [], "organisationRole": [{"offerGrant": 69748.0, "projectCost": 99633.0, "id": "8712E96E-B7C4-44B5-B80F-76DF545D9419", "name": "AntiverSE Ltd", "address": {"line1": "34 Roath Court Road", "city": "Cardiff", "postCode": "CF24 3SD", "region": "Unknown"}, "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/8712E96E-B7C4-44B5-B80F-76DF545D9419", "role": [{"name": "LEAD_PARTICIPANT"}, {"name": "PARTICIPANT"}]}]}, "0DFE4BC1-D0DD-422B-A071-99B775B88470": {"project": {"title": "Antibody Discovery Platform with Machine Learning", "status": "Active", "grantCategory": "Collaborative R&D", "grantReference": "105979", "abstractText": "Antibodies are produced by the body's plasma cells and used by the immune system to combat pathogens that cause disease e.g. bacteria or viruses.

We must ensure that there are good reasons for us to trust their use. That is, as Baroness Onora O'Neill has said, we should aim for reliable measures of trustworthiness. Three key measures are: \nFairness - measuring and mitigating undesirable bias against individuals or subgroups;\nTransparency/interpretability/explainability - improving our understanding of how ML systems work in real-world applications; and\nRobustness - aiming for reliably good performance even when a system encounters different settings from those in which it was trained.\n\nThis fellowship will advance work on key technical underpinnings of fairness, transparency and robustness of ML systems, and develop timely key applications which work at scale in real world health and criminal justice settings, focusing on interpretability and robustness of medical imaging diagnosis systems, and criminal recidivism prediction. The project will connect with industry, social scientists, ethicists, lawyers, policy makers, stakeholders and the broader public, aiming for two-way engagement - to listen carefully to needs and concerns in order to build the right tools, and in turn to inform policy, users and the public in order to maximise beneficial impacts for society.\n\nThis work is of key national importance for the core UK strategy of being a world leader in safe and ethical AI. As the Prime Minister said in his first speech to the UN, &quot;Can these algorithms be trusted with our lives and our hopes?&quot; If we get this right, we will help ensure fair, transparent benefits across society while protecting citizens from harm, and avoid the potential for a public backlash against AI developments. Without trustworthiness, people will have reason to be afraid of new ML technologies, presenting a barrier to responsible innovation. Trustworthiness removes frictions preventing people from embracing new systems, with great potential to spur economic growth and prosperity in the UK, while delivering equitable benefits for society. Trustworthy ML is a key component of Responsible AI - just announced as one of four key themes of the new Global Partnership on AI.\n\nFurther, this work is needed urgently - ML systems are already being deployed in ways which impact many lives. In particular, healthcare and criminal justice are crucial areas with timely potential to benefit from new technology to improve outcomes, consistency and efficiency, yet there are important ethical concerns which this work will address.

This diversity has real implications for medicine, and helps to explain why apparently similar patients often respond very differently to the same therapies. However, we remain limited in our ability to account for such diversity in the clinic. \u201cPrecision medicine\u201d refers to the emerging idea of using molecular measurements (such as gene sequences or protein levels) to match individual patients to the therapies from which they are most likely to benefit. Machine learning (ML) is a field that combines ideas from computer science, mathematics and statistics to find patterns in data. Our research explores how we can exploit the power of statistics and ML to enable precision medicine. Our long-term goal is to develop methods that can exploit large datasets to provide doctors information that can help in treating patients. We work on the mathematical and computational side, inventing new ways to look at complex data that can tease out relevant patterns, and work closely with biomedical researchers in the UK, US and Europe.", "technicalSummary": "Our work focuses on the development and application of statistical and machine learning approaches that can exploit molecular and genomic data to assist in directing therapies to patients likely to benefit. Our efforts encompass both (i) direct prediction of therapeutic response and (ii) scalable estimation of molecular networks and dynamics that can shed light on disease mechanisms and heterogeneity, inform prediction of response and help in identifying promising therapeutic opportunities. We work on specific biomedical questions, addressed in collaboration with experimental groups, as well as methodological research in statistics and machine learning motivated by such questions.\n\nThe potential of computational approaches in medicine is increasingly clear, but the challenges posed by noisy and incomplete data, biological and clinical heterogeneity and complex underlying processes and dynamics remain substantial. Our work is aimed at developing and exploiting statistical methods that can help to surmount some of these challenges. High-dimensional approaches, networks and graphical models and inference for dynamical systems are key methodological themes in much of our work. \n\nTwo key ongoing projects are:\n\nData-driven characterization of biological networks in cancer. How is the genomic heterogeneity of cancer manifested at the level of biological networks, such as those involved in cell signalling? Do cancers show altered \u201cwiring\u201d due to genomic aberrations? And if so, how? In close collaboration with experimental partners, we are working on both theoretical and applied aspects of these questions. We are also investigating whether protein signalling networks differ by cancer type and how networks can be used to help discover and define cancer subtypes. Finally, we are developing scalable methodologies by which to systematically assess causal network estimation approaches using interventional data. \n\nStatistical methods for personalized medicine. We are addressing statistical challenges that arise in the prediction of drug response from multiple high-throughput data types. These challenges include the large number of potential predictors (high-dimensionality), heterogeneity arising from known and unknown disease subtypes, limited number of samples and the need to integrate multiple data types.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 286047, "start": "2014-03-01", "end": "2016-11-30", "funder": {"id": "C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C", "name": "MRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"}, "type": "EXPENDITURE_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [{"id": "79FD4291-92D2-4B8E-B6FD-01108A5C02EC", "outcomeId": "5464775733ee99.47766919-1", "description": "Mills Lab, MDACC", "collaboratingOrganisation": "University of Texas", "department": "M.

"status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "grantReference": "EP/R012261/1", "abstractText": "When programmers make mistakes, costs can be huge. Programmers make mistakes because they are human. To help them, researchers are developing tools. No tool is a silver bullet; each has advantages and disadvantages. We focus on one kind of tool: the runtime verifiers. Programmers use runtime verifiers more and more, which attests to their utility. Runtime verifiers observe a program while it runs and look for signs that something is amiss. This slows down the program, which is why runtime verifiers are used only by programmers, before releasing the program to users. If runtime verifiers would be more efficient and would not slow down programs so much, then they could remain active in released programs, which would make them more useful. For example, they could be used for detecting security intrusions in deployed systems.\n\nThis research project is focused on increasing the efficiency of runtime verifiers.\n\n\nA Cambridge study from 2013 estimated that the worldwide cost of fixing software defects to be $310 billion per year. A large part of this cost is programmer time. The interval between finding a defect and fixing it is not so small because the task is often not so easy. Some defects are security vulnerabilities, which makes the fixing interval a window of opportunity for criminals. The window of opportunity is bigger than the fixing interval because it also includes the time until users decide to update their software. The size of the window of opportunity is important. For example, updating software regularly is recommended by the UK government, in its Cyber Essentials Scheme. This guidance was issued after a government study showed that, in 2014, nine out of ten large organisations in UK suffered security breaches, and each security breach had an average cost of 1.5 million pounds.\n\nRuntime verifiers could be used to reduce the window of opportunity that criminals have, as follows. Programmers describe scenarios that should not happen. A runtime verifier then observes the program while it runs and, if one of the forbidden scenarios does happen, then the runtime verifier can take an action. For example, the runtime verifier could be instructed to kill the program, because a program crash is preferable to a security breach. Alas, such a use case for runtime verifiers is unrealistic at the moment, because no user would tolerate a program that runs ten times slower than usual just for the benefit of extra protection against security intrusions. In this project we aim at finding a better trade-off. We want the program to run only slightly slower than usual and, in return, we are willing to give up some of the guarantees offered by a runtime verifier, but not much. But, how to find a good trade-off? The key will be using a toolkit developed recently in the machine learning community.", "potentialImpactText": "Let us describe a vision, an ideal outcome, in which everything in this research proposal goes according to plan. By the end of 2019, the TOPL runtime verifier will be a reliable and efficient tool that developers use increasingly. Using TOPL, developers deliver software with two versions: standard and hardened. The hardened version is slightly slower but comes with extra protections. With high probability, when a developer assumption is violated, the hardened version informs them. Also with high probability, security intrusions relying on software defects are intercepted and interrupted.\n\nThere will be some limitations. For example, TOPL works only with the Java programming language and the TOPL property-specification language. It might be that the latter is not expressive enough in some situations. However, the basic techniques we will develop will not be tied-in with either Java or TOPL. Authors of other runtime verifiers will want to adapt our techniques to their tools. Some of these tools will be academic (such as MarQ, LARVA, Mufin); others will be commercial (such as RV-Monitor and RV-Predict). Tools like AdressSanitizer, which are widely used and have characteristics similar to runtime verifiers, may also make use of some of our techniques.\n\nUltimately, progress in the area of runtime verification will lead to higher quality software, which will reduce the economic cost of software. Developers will spend a smaller fraction of their time fixing mistakes. Security intrusions will be successful less often.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 100917, "start": "2018-01-01", "end": "2020-06-30", "funder": {"id": "798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C", "name": "EPSRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [], "artisticAndCreativeProductOutput": [], "softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput": [], "researchDatabaseAndModelOutput": [], "spinOutOutput": [], "impactSummaryOutput": [], "furtherFundingOutput": [], "otherResearchOutput": [], "exploitationOutput": [], "disseminationOutput": [], "keyFindingsOutput": {"id": "3AA864FE-E2C4-4550-93C8-1FF691FFE9BE", "outcomeId": "5c811f505dbe85.62112689", "description": "In runtime verification, one monitors events occurring in a running program, to detect error conditions. The key finding is that one can reduce drastically the amount of events observed if the runtime verification phase is guided by the results of a pre-analysis of the program code, which is static. In our experiments we found that in roughly 90% of cases it is possible to statically decide whether the error condition may or may not occur. In the rest 10%, it is sufficient to observe roughly half of the interesting events, and still eventually reach the same conclusion as to whether an error condition occurred.\n\nThe main shortcomings of this result are that (a) it was established for non-parametric error conditions and (b) it was established by statically simulating runtime verification, rather than by actual runtime verification.

This proposal addresses the paramount problem of oligopeptide (and ultimately protein) structure prediction from a theoretical and computational point of view. A recent and authoritative review by Ponder and Case (one of the authors of the popular computer program AMBER) argues that biomolecular modelling will grind to a halt unless the accuracy of current force fields is substantially increased. We believe that the best way forward is by starting afresh rather than by tweaking existing force fields. The design of force fields such as AMBER was based on the computing power available in the 1980s. Since that time computing power has increased by a factor 10,000, which means that a novel force field design philosophy can be adopted, avoiding from the outset the approximations of force fields such as AMBER. In our previous work we introduced multipole moments to replace point charges. Multipole moments reflect better the local electron density of an atom than do point charges, which wrongly assume that this density is spherical. Multipole moments model the electrostatic interaction between one atom and another more accurately, especially at short range. We use the modern theory of Quantum Chemical Topology (aka 'Atoms in Molecules') to partition the electron density of small molecules into atomic fragments. These fragments then 'dress up' a protein/peptide backbone and provide detailed information on its electron density. Quantum topological atoms have a finite volume of variable shape, which can be nicely visualised. These atoms are also widely documented, strongly rooted in quantum mechanics and used for interpretative purposes (e.g. charge transfer, hydrogen bonding). While designing a force field along these lines we modeled the pivotal electrostatic interaction energy upfront, without fitting, as is done in constructing classical force fields. Our approach drastically reduces the number of fitted parameters. Moreover fitted charges are not necessarily transferable from small molecules to larger ones. On the other hand, quantum topological atoms are transferable to a very large extent. Only the remaining energy contributions then need to be fitted to 'ab initio' energies, forces and vibrational frequencies of training molecules. In this proposal we focus on the polarisation of the electron density, that is, the change in the electron density upon a change in the nuclear positions. The novel element is to use advanced machine learning to capture the relation between fluctuating multipole moments and nuclear positions. The input of the Genetic Programming algorithm are the coordinates of the neighbouring atoms of a given central atom and the output is a given fluctuating multipole moment of the central atom. If successful, the proposed methodology is expected to work for other important classes of biochemical compounds as well, such as nucleotides (DNA, RNA), carbohydrates and lipids, which will be tackled in future projects. Given an increase in computer power of at least two orders of magnitude occurring over the next decade we aim at guaranteeing a more secure future of macromolecular modeling. Given the momentum built up in our group we are in an ideal position to consolidate all the components of the design, previously researched and published, into a coherent software package that will be freely available to the UK research community.", "technicalSummary": "The potential energy functions used in biomoelcular modelling must be improved in order to secure its future predictive power and trust of the experimental community. In our previous work we replaced point charges by atomic multipole moments in order to improve the accuracy of the (short-range) electrostatic interaction. Quantum Chemical Topology (aka 'atoms in Molecules') uses molecular electron density to define atoms as finite volumes shaped by the molecular enviroment they occur in. In this proposal we focus on atomic polarisation, i.e. how the electron density of a topological atom fluctuates upon a change in nuclear positions of its neighbouring atoms. We do not follow an existing method (such as the Drude/shell model, electronegativity equalisation, effective polarisation, polarisable point dipoles, etc.). Instead we adopt a modern machine learning method called Genetic Programming to directly establish the link between an atom's electron density reponsing to a geometrical change in immediate environment. Summarising the proposed method, focus on a given atom in a molecule. Normal modes generate hundreds of molecular geometries, representing the ever changing environment of an atom, including bond length and angle variations, and conformational flexibility. Quantum Chemical Topology cuts this given atom out of each of the distorted molecular charge density and calculates the corresponding atomic multipole moments. The latter fluctuate in response to a change in molecular geometry and it is these data that the Genetic Programming algorithm is trained on. Our proposed method is totally new, which is why we need this feasible study.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 105462, "start": "2007-12-01", "end": "2009-02-28", "funder": {"id": "2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7", "name": "BBSRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [], "artisticAndCreativeProductOutput": [], "softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput": [], "researchDatabaseAndModelOutput": [], "spinOutOutput": [], "impactSummaryOutput": [], "furtherFundingOutput": [], "otherResearchOutput": [], "exploitationOutput": [], "disseminationOutput": []}, "publication": [{"title": "Optimal construction of a fast and accurate polarisable water potential based on multipole moments trained by machine learning.", "parentPublicationTitle": "Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP", "author": [{"otherNames": "Handley CM", "id": "a9fc5b9483af5e4733b14810a9677231", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/a9fc5b9483af5e4733b14810a9677231"}], "date": "2009-01-01", "issn": "1463-9076", "id": "E62C48F8-3951-48B6-BC50-170F1E42D55E", "outcomeId": "54609b7150a854.19706670", "firstAuthorName": "Handley CM"}], "identifier": [{"value": "BB/F003617/1", "type": "RCUK"}], "healthCategory": [], "researchActivity": [], "researchSubject": [], "researchTopic": [{"id": "D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819", "text": "Unclassified", "encodedText": "Unclassified"}], "rcukProgramme": [], "id": "9D584314-0486-40BB-84ED-922985EDE245", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/projects?ref=BB%2FF003617%2F1"}, "leadResearchOrganisation": {"name": "University of Manchester", "department": "Chemistry", "address": {"line1": "Oxford Road", "city": "Manchester", "postCode": "M13 9PL", "region": "North West", "country": "United Kingdom"}, "typeInd": "RO", "id": "68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993"}, "personRole": [{"role": [{"name": "PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}], "id": "E320D9A1-0D2A-45A2-8A4F-6B19D88E8C19", "firstName": "Paul Lode Albert", "surname": "Popelier", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/E320D9A1-0D2A-45A2-8A4F-6B19D88E8C19"}], "collaborator": [], "organisationRole": [{"role": [{"name": "LEAD_RO"}], "id": "68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993", "name": "University of Manchester", "address": {"line1": "Oxford Road", "city": "Manchester", "postCode": "M13 9PL", "region": "North West", "country": "United Kingdom"}, "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/68D0E3C9-9246-4CFC-B5E9-48584CF82993"}]}, "52E28BD8-ECD8-4FAC-8FCD-D1960F4E5233": {"project": {"title": "Network on Computational Statistics and Machine Learning", "status": "Closed", "grantCategory": "Research Grant", "grantReference": "EP/K009788/2", "abstractText": "The aim of this network is to establish the UK as the world leading authority in the joint area of Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CompStat &amp; ML) by advancing communication, interchange and collaboration within the UK between the disciplines of Computational Statistics (CompStat) and Machine Learning (ML).\n\nThe UK has tremendous research strength and depth that is widely acknowledged as world leading in both the individual areas of Computational Statistics and Machine Learning.

The availability of the Research roadmap as it evolves will communicate the emerging research agenda to external agencies as well as direct adopters and developers of research results. \n\nThe annual Network workshops will be an excellent means with which to communicate developments within the Network and act as a means of establishing new collaborations within and without the Network to further widen access to Network activities.\n\nIn addition joint publications in the main journals and presentation at the main conferences of each of the respective areas covered will be pursued to ensure persistence of visibility of the outcome of Network based collaborations. Furthermore special sessions which will be jointly organised and supported by the network at the main leading international meetings (e.g. JSM, ISBA, NIPS, ICML) will provide an excellent way in which to propagate the joint research themes emerging from the Network.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 93194, "start": "2014-01-06", "end": "2016-11-05", "funder": {"id": "798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C", "name": "EPSRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [], "artisticAndCreativeProductOutput": [], "softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput": [], "researchDatabaseAndModelOutput": [], "spinOutOutput": [], "impactSummaryOutput": [], "furtherFundingOutput": [], "otherResearchOutput": [], "exploitationOutput": [], "disseminationOutput": []}, "publication": [{"title": "Preferential Attachment of Specific Fluorescent Dyes and Dye Labeled DNA Sequences in a Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Multiplex.", "parentPublicationTitle": "Analytical chemistry", "author": [{"otherNames": "Gracie K", "id": "5eefcbf72c34051f3029577cf4dfb09d", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/5eefcbf72c34051f3029577cf4dfb09d"}], "date": "2016-01-01", "issn": "0003-2700", "id": "8BDDD066-D6AC-41C4-81B6-D4A8B59255AB", "outcomeId": "585d703ab07d78.68668765", "firstAuthorName": "Gracie K"}, {"title": "Limit theorems for the zig-zag process", "parentPublicationTitle": "Advances in Applied Probability", "author": [{"otherNames": "Bierkens J", "id": "769e2422dd544628db3ce8ddffaa2ec0", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/person/769e2422dd544628db3ce8ddffaa2ec0"}], "date": "2017-01-01", "issn": "0001-8678", "id": "B7787A80-9F08-45CF-8617-0B2AE1D1838A", "outcomeId": "5a637a6c287357.98454222", "firstAuthorName": "Bierkens J"}], "identifier": [{"value": "EP/K009788/2", "type": "RCUK"}], "projectHierarchy": {"parent": [{"id": "F066F6B0-65C5-4CFA-9E62-493CBA854C6B", "grantRef": "EP/K009788/1", "amount": 104530.4, "start": "2013-06-24", "end": "2014-01-06", "child": [{"id": "52E28BD8-ECD8-4FAC-8FCD-D1960F4E5233", "grantRef": "EP/K009788/2", "amount": 93194.73, "start": "2014-01-06", "end": "2016-11-05", "rel": "Transfer", "child": []}]}]}, "healthCategory": [], "researchActivity": [], "researchSubject": [{"id": "EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C", "text": "Info. & commun.

In tribology, it is the surface interactions that influence such quantities as friction, wear and the lifetime of a component. In fluid dynamics, it is the surface that determines how fluids flow and it affects such properties as aerodynamic lift, therefore, influencing efficiency and fuel consumption of aircraft. Examples of the relationships between the topography of a surface and how that surface functions in use can be found in almost every manufacturing sector, both traditional and high-tech. To control surface topography, and hence the function and/or performance of a component, it must be measured and useful parameters extracted from the measurement data. There are a large number instruments that can measure surface topography, but many of them cannot be used realistically for real-time in-process applications due to the need for scanning in either the lateral axes and/or the vertical axis. There have been developments in area-integrating (scattering) methods for measuring surface topography that can be fast enough to use during a manufacturing process, but these are limited in the height range of surface topography with which they can be used.\n\nIn conventional machining, there has been a significant research effort to determine the surface topography of the machined parts during the manufacturing process. The dominant technology for this has been machine vision approaches, where a relationship between a texture parameter and an aspect of the measured field from an intensity sensor is determined. Such approaches have two major drawbacks: 1. they are usually applied to surfaces with geometrical features over a limited range and 2. they do not have the benefit of a physical model of the measurement process, i.e. they are purely empirical. As an example, the measurement and characterisation of the surface topography of additive manufactured parts remains a significant challenge, especially where measurement speed may be an issue. Typical metal additive manufactured surfaces have a large range of surface features, with the dominant features often being the weld tracks with typical wavelengths of a few hundred micrometres and amplitudes of a few tens of micrometres; such structures are beyond what can be measured effectively with existing commercial approaches. \n\nIn the proposed project, we aim to demonstrate that it is possible to measure rough and structured, machined or additive surfaces using a simple, cost-effective real-time measurement system. This will involve the development of a fully rigorous three-dimensional optical scattering model, which will be combined with a machine learning approach to mine optical scattering data for topographic information that is not within the range of commercial scattering instruments. The proposed system could be mounted into a machining or additive operation without slowing down the process, therefore, reducing the cost of many advanced products that require engineered surfaces. To demonstrate the commercial potential of the project outputs, we have several advanced manufacturing partners who will supply industrially relevant case studies and one partner who could act as the commercial exploitation route for the instrument.", "fund": {"valuePounds": 196575, "start": "2018-06-01", "end": "2021-05-31", "funder": {"id": "798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C", "name": "EPSRC", "url": "https://gtr.ukri.org:443/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"}, "type": "INCOME_ACTUAL"}, "output": {"collaborationOutput": [], "intellectualPropertyOutput": [], "policyInfluenceOutput": [], "productOutput": [], "researchMaterialOutput": [], "artisticAndCreativeProductOutput": [], "softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput": [], "researchDatabaseAndModelOutput": [], "spinOutOutput": [], "impactSummaryOutput": [], "furtherFundingOutput": [{"id": "2442CFC6-DF3F-4452-8329-B6DD3D01E72B", "outcomeId": "5c837b6a490f50.92669784", "description": "Revisiting optical scattering with machine learning (SPARKLE)", "amountPounds": 196575, "fundingRef": "EP/R028842/1", "fundingOrg": "Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)", "currCountryCode": "United Kingdom", "currLang": "en_GB", "currCode": "GBP", "sector": "Public", "country": "United Kingdom", "start": "2018-06-01", "end": "2021-05-02"}], "otherResearchOutput": [], "exploitationOutput": [], "disseminationOutput": [{"id": "37C025A5-8D5F-44A6-BFDA-41E77451AF84", "outcomeId": "5c839eb7728b14.78984744", "description": "Invited talk at MetMap (Sheffield AMRC  2019)", "impact": "This was a mixed group of industrialists/academics", "url": "https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/conference/fac-eng/metmap-2019", "form": "A talk or presentation", "geographicReach": "Regional", "primaryAudience": "Industry/Business", "year": "2019", "partOfOfficialScheme": false}], "keyFindingsOutput": {"id": "EAA5989D-4CB0-45C8-A755-04D8702E0723", "outcomeId": "5c83ca4ea33c77.16165722", "description": "We have considered the classic problem of electromagnetic scattering from the interface between two or more homogenous media.
